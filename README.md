# Car-Positioning-System-GPS-
Car Positioning System(GPS) - by SIM808 and CVAVR
this system uses an atmega328 and a 64*128 GLCD with a sim808 module to get location data from GPS satellites and show different data such as speed of car, time, AMSL(above mean sea level), and also network connection.
in case of an accident, the pressure of impact will be detected by implemented sensors(which need to be designed and are not installed for this project) and the live location of the vehicle will be sent directly to emergency and police by SMS.
